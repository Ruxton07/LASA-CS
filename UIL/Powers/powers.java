/*
 * There are two 4-digit numbers that if you raise each of their digits to the
 * 7th power and add them
 * together you get a number that in the octal number representation is equal to
 * the original number.
 * Letâ€™s try this with the number 2123. The sum of all four digits of 2123 each
 * raised to the 7th power is
 * 2
 * 7 + 17 + 27 + 37 = 2444
 * Treating 2444 as an octal number we see that its decimal value is 1316.
 * However, since 1316 is
 * not equal to the original number 2123, this is NOT one of the two numbers we
 * are looking for.
 * Input
 * None.
 * Output
 * Print each of the numbers on a separate line
